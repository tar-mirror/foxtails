FoxTails is a set of pure Ruby extensions for FXRuby. (FXRuby is the Ruby bindings for the Fox C++ GUI library. See http://fxruby.sourceforge.net.)

This is an alpha release, so documentation is still very sketchy, and there are no tests. There are examples, though. See also the comments in foxtails.rb for a basic roadmap of the library.

FoxTails depends on observable:

http://www.ruby-lang.org/raa/list.rhtml?name=observable

and of course fox/fxruby:

http://fxruby.sourceforge.net
http://www.fox-toolkit.org

The install process is the standard one:

  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  ruby install.rb install

=== Observable attributes

The most useful part of FoxTails is the use of observable attributes to connect
GUI components, as an alternative to directly using Fox's target mechanism. It
helps you separate your Ruby object model from the GUI representation. It's
very easy to use. See the examples.

Some features:

- Deferred targets. By using a code block (in place of the object itself) to indicate the target of a widget, there is no need to worry about initialization order, which leads to better decoupling.

- In the FoxTails API, the argument lists have the same form as Fox argument lists, except that the tgt,sel args are replaced by a target, an accessor, and sometimes other args. So it's easy to use existing documentation and to convert old programs.

- Works with existing accessors provided by FXRuby (e.g., #enabled=, etc.) (see examples/scroll.rb).

- Updates happen with no delay! (This is esp. nice for menus, which always bothered me in Fox.)

- Values (e.g. in text fields, combo boxes) can be anything, not just numbers or strings (see examples/combo.rb). Fields can be automatically validated.

- Easy shortcuts for creating fields. See examples/fields.b.

=== Other features

FoxTails also includes some "megawidgets", such as a dir broswer with bookmarks. See examples/file-browser.rb and examples/simple.rb, which also shows how easy it is to link multiple widgets to a ruby object attribute. See foxtails.rb for brief descriptions.

There is some preliminary and experimental support for connecting trees to tree browsers using FoxTails targeting mechanism. See FTTreeList and examples/tree.rb.
