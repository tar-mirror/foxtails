foxtails 0.6

- Updated to Fox/FXRuby 1.6

foxtails 0,5

- Updated to Fox/FXRuby 1.4

foxtails 0,4

- FoxTails now supports Fox 1.2 *only*.

- FTField now supports targets other than self--see example/fields.rb.

- FTNonModal: easy way to "execute" a non-modal dialog. See
  examples/nonmodal.rb. (This is available in recent FXRuby.)

foxtails 0.3

- FTFields and examples/fields.rb: easy creation of static text and a variety
  of input fields using edit text, check and radio buttons, and option menus.

- FTOptionMenu and examples/opt-menu.rb: fits option menus into the
  targeting framework using observable attrs.
  
- Validation for text fields.

- The main foxtails.rb file now uses autoload to lazily require most of the
  rest of foxtails. There is no longer need to 'require "FTFileBrowser"', for
  example. Start time should be a little better.

- FTActionButton: keeps button in "engaged" state while action runs.

- examples/disconnect.rb (thanks to Will Merrell for asking questions!)

- GUI option for examples/chat-server.rb (which helps on windows). (The
  example shows use of observable attrs over a drb connection to connect
  widgets in multiple Fox apps.)

foxtails 0.2

- Several new examples.

- Added FTTreeBrowser and related files.

- Updated to Ruby 1.8.0.
